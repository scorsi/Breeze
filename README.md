# Breeze - Highlight your code, not the language syntax

Breeze is like Lua in C++ but for the Java Platform.

Breeze has the easiest syntax ever created:
 - 5 types only
 - dynamic typing and dynamic casting
 - no keywords
 - everything is a prototype/object
 - the syntaxe rules fit in 10 lines

Inspired by Pharo, JavaScript and Kotlin:
  - everything is object _as Kotlin, Pharo and Javascript_
  - classes are maps (or maps are classes ?) _as Javascript_
  - functions looks like lambdas (they simply are variable, they can be returned, passed as parameter and reattributed) _as Pharo_
  - objects got `let` method (simplify your data flow with functionnal thinking) _as Kotlin_
  - `while` don't exists, maps and arrays got `forEach` method _as Koltin_
  - `if` don't exists, use `ifTrue` and `ifFalse` or `if` methods on boolean object instead of keyword _as Pharo_
